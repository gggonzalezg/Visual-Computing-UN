# Visual-Computing-UN
Repository used for visual computing class in Universidad nacional de Colombia

Contains a shaders workshop. In this task is going to be made a comparison between convolutions processed
by hardware and software

# _HARDWARE VS. SOFTWARE CONVOLUTIONS_
## OBJECTIVES
1. Compare convolutions hardware-generated performance versus convolutions software-generated.
2. Process a Bogota photo which has a lot of colors and edges in order to see how work the different
convolution kernels.
3. Learn to use different kernels to process images.

## IMPLEMENTATION
1. It is going to be used this image.

2. For hardware, it is going to be used convolution kernels with 3x3 Matrix.

3. For software, it is going to be used edegsfrag.glsl and embossfrag.gsls in order to process images
with the GPU.

## DEMO
Just run Convolution.pde Sketch.
